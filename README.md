# Hadoop-HA-Cluster
# Hadoop High Availability (HA) Cluster with Docker

This project sets up a High Availability Hadoop cluster using Docker and ZooKeeper. It features:
- 3 NameNodes (for HA using ZooKeeper & JournalNodes)
- 3 ResourceManagers (for YARN HA)
- Multiple DataNodes and NodeManagers
- Fully Dockerized infrastructure for reproducibility and ease of deployment

## ðŸ”§ Components

- **HDFS**: Configured with HA using three NameNodes.
- **YARN**: Configured with ResourceManager HA.
- **ZooKeeper**: Ensures leader election and failover.
- **Docker + Docker Compose**: Container orchestration.
